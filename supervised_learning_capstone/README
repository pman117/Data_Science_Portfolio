An solid attempt to be able to predict deaths  in an arbritrary  3 million sample of automobile accidents occuring in France, identify the most potentially significant features which contribute to said casualties and being able to make an inference on the population of drivers and automobile accidents. One of the most challenging problems faced while working with the data was narrowing down 52 non linear, non correlation having features to only a mere few but most relevant features contributing to automobile accidents. Dimension reduction via intuitive reduction followed by ols statsmodel pvalue reduction and lastly random forest most significant features reduction technique helped me immensely to narrow it down to 7 features.
