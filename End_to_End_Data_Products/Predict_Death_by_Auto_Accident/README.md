# Predict Death by Auto Accident

#### -- Project Status: [ Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
 Research Question(Framing the problem): Can the said before mentioned data containing numerous (categorical/discrete/qualitative) (nominal) variables pretransformed to numerical variables potentially be significant enough to contribute to the outcome(severity of the accident) and be able to predict death or no death in an accident via machine learning models? If any, which variables would be the most significant?


### Methods Used
* Raw data gathering & cleaning
* EDA (Descriptive Statistics)
    * Data Visualization
* Inferential Statistics
    * machine learning/predicting modeling


### Technologies
* Python
* Anaconda
* Pandas, jupyter,numpy, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn,sklearn, hyperopt


## Project Description
* raw data contains:
    * plethora of variables which contribute to the severity of road accidents in France from 2005 to 2016
    * 4 different data sources:
        * caracteristics
        * users
        * vehicles
        * places
    * CSV file format
    * 3 million samples -> 52 parameters/sample
    
* challenges throughout entire data science process:
    * renaming the parameters( x input variables) to be more meaningful
    * severity of accident (y outcome dependent variable) is class imbalanced
