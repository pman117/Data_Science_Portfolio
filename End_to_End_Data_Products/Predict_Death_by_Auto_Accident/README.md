# Predict Death by Auto Accident

#### -- Project Status: [ Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
 Research Question(Framing the problem): Can the said before mentioned data containing numerous (categorical/discrete/qualitative) (nominal) variables pretransformed to numerical variables potentially be significant enough to contribute to the outcome(severity of the accident) and be able to predict death or no death in an accident via machine learning models? If any, which variables would be the most significant?


### Methods Used
* Raw data gathering & cleaning
* EDA (Descriptive Statistics)
    * Data Visualization
* Inferential Statistics
    * machine learning/predicting modeling


### Technologies
* Python
* Anaconda
* Pandas, jupyter,numpy, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn,sklearn, hyperopt


## Project Description
* raw data contains:
    * plethora of variables which contribute to the severity of road accidents in France from 2005 to 2016
    * 4 different data sources:
        * caracteristics
        * users
        * vehicles
        * places
    * CSV file format
    * 3 million samples -> 52 parameters/sample
    
* challenges throughout entire data science process:
    * renaming the parameters( x input variables) to be more meaningful
    * severity of accident (y outcome dependent variable) is class imbalanced
    

## Needs of this project

- construct valuable data science project & entire data science process:
    - Frame the problem
    - Initial Evaluation of potential value of said project if implemented
    - Determine current Approch/Create Baseline Model
    - Team Discussion of the Data Science Process
    - Collect necessary raw data
    - Process Data for analysis

## Getting Started
1. Setup up environment:
    
2. Clone folder containing project:
    - remote:
        - https://github.com/pman117/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/End_to_End_Data_Products/Predict_Death_by_Auto_Accident
    - utilize git sparse checkout
        - excellent tutorial here:
            - https://briancoyner.github.io/2013/06/05/git-sparse-checkout.html
            
3. Raw Data is being kept here within this folder (https://github.com/pman117/Data_Science_Portfolio/tree/master/End_to_End_Data_Products/Predict_Death_by_Auto_Accident/Raw_Data)

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*
